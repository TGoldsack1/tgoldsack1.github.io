    abstract = "Lay summarisation aims to jointly summarise and simplify a given text, thus making its content more comprehensible to non-experts.Automatic approaches for lay summarisation can provide significant value in broadening access to scientific literature, enabling a greater degree of both interdisciplinary knowledge sharing and public understanding when it comes to research findings. However, current corpora for this task are limited in their size and scope, hindering the development of broadly applicable data-driven approaches. Aiming to rectify these issues, we present two novel lay summarisation datasets, PLOS (large-scale) and eLife (medium-scale), each of which contains biomedical journal articles alongside expert-written lay summaries.We provide a thorough characterisation of our lay summaries, highlighting differing levels of readability and abstractivenessbetween datasets that can be leveraged to support the needs of different applications.Finally, we benchmark our datasets using mainstream summarisation approaches and perform a manual evaluation with domain experts, demonstrating their utility and casting light on the key challenges of this task.",

  abstract = {Scientific articles tend to follow a standardised discourse that enables a reader to quickly identify and extract useful or important information. We hypothesise that such structural conventions are strongly influenced by the scientific domain (e.g., Computer Science, Chemistry, etc.) and explore this through a novel extractive algorithm that utilises domain-specific discourse information for the task of abstract generation. In addition to being both simple and lightweight, the proposed algorithm constructs summaries in a structured and interpretable manner. In spite of these factors, we show that our approach outperforms strong baselines on the arXiv scientific summarisation dataset in both automatic and human evaluations, confirming that a scientific article's domain strongly influences its discourse structure and can be leveraged to effectively improve its summarisation.

    abstract = "This paper presents the results of the shared task on Lay Summarisation of Biomedical Research Articles (BioLaySumm), hosted at the BioNLP Workshop at ACL 2023. The goal of this shared task is to develop abstractive summarisation models capable of generating {``}lay summaries{''} (i.e., summaries that are comprehensible to non-technical audiences) in both a controllable and non-controllable setting.There are two subtasks: 1) Lay Summarisation, where the goal is for participants to build models for lay summary generation only, given the full article text and the corresponding abstract as input; and2) Readability-controlled Summarisation, where the goal is for participants to train models to generate both the technical abstract and the lay summary, given an article{'}s main text as input.In addition to overall results, we report on the setup and insights from the BioLaySumm shared task, which attracted a total of 20 participating teams across both subtasks.",
