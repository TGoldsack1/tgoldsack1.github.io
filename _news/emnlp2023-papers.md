I have had 2 long papers accepted to the [EMNLP 2023](https://2023.emnlp.org/) main conference! One first author paper - "Enhancing Biomedical Lay Summarisation with External Knowledge Graphs", and a second paper - "Improving Biomedical Abstractive Summarisation with Knowledge Aggregation from Citation Papers".
