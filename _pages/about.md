I am a final-year PhD candidate at the [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training Speech and Language Technologies](https://slt-cdt.ac.uk/) @ the University of Sheffield, where I am supervised by [Dr. Chenghua Lin](https://chenghualin.wordpress.com/) and [Dr. Carolina Scarton](https://carolscarton.github.io/).
My work is focused mainly on the summarisation of scientific or specialist text, with an emphasis on broadening access to technical content through the generation of readable, non-expert summaries.

<!-- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
